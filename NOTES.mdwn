DESIGN DOCUMENT
===============
Current scope/goal - human wandering around a world using love.physics.

actor
-----
Contains physics objects, is drawable.

world
-----
contains all actors, etc.
contains the world physics object.
Has a draw method for everything within that world. UI stuff can come later.

adding actors to worlds
-----------------------
The constructor for an actor's body requires a world to put it in.
If actors only exist in one world at a time (YES), then the world can be
unique to the actor, hence used in the constructor.

bodies
------
Properties to use:
* position (x,y)
* velocity (x,y)
* mass
* linear damping (drag)

* angle
* angular velocity
* inertia (angular mass)
* angular damping
